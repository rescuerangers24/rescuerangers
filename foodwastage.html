<p>Food wastage in India is a significant issue, with large amounts of food being wasted at various stages from production to consumption. Here's a rough estimate of food wastage and a solution framework:

    <b> Food Wastage Estimates:</b><br>
    - Per Day: Approximately 67 million tons of food is wasted annually, which translates to about 183,561 tons per day.<br>
    - Per Month: This would be around 5.5 million tons per month.<br>
    - Per Year: As mentioned, approximately 67 million tons annually.<br>
    
    <b>Proposed Solution:</b><br>
    Rescue Rangers Application<br>
    
    1. User Registration: Individuals and businesses can register on the application.<br>
    2. Request Pickup: Users can call or message through the app to request a food pickup.<br>
    3. Team Dispatch: The Rescue Rangers team is dispatched to collect the food from the specified location.<br>
    4. Food Donation: Collected food is donated to shelters, NGOs, or directly to those in need.<br>
    
     <b>Benefits:</b><br>
    - Reducing Waste: Helps in minimizing food wastage.<br>
    - Helping the Needy: Provides food to those in need, addressing hunger issues.<br>
    - Environmental Impact: Reduces the environmental footprint by decreasing the amount of food waste in landfills.<br>
    
    <b> Steps to Implement:</b><br>
    1. Develop the App: Create a user-friendly application with easy navigation.<br>
    2. Partner with NGOs: Collaborate with NGOs and shelters for food distribution.<br>
    3. Awareness Campaign: Run awareness campaigns to encourage participation.<br>
    4. Logistics: Set up a robust logistics network to ensure timely food pickups and deliveries.<br>
    5. Quality Control: Implement measures to ensure the collected food is safe and suitable for consumption.<br>
    
    By integrating this solution, we can address the dual issues of food wastage and hunger effectively.</p>
